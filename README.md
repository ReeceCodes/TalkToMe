adds a context menu when highlighting text so that you can select it to be read aloud

I have included everything except my images. The package is available for Chrome.

The files are a little messy and not  perfect formatting as I wasn't using a js formatter at the time. 

What it does?
When highlighting text you can use the shortcut (shift+ctrl+space) or the context menu to read the selected text aloud. using the ctr+shift+space shortcut or the context menu again to stop the currently reading text.

It also has an options page (ctrl+shift+1 shortcut) to change all the available options for reading text (voice, pitch, rate, etc).
